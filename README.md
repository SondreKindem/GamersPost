## Shameless [The Gamer's Post](https://thegamerspost.com/) ripoff, for fun (also it is down as of writing this) :)

The rss parser is mostly a copy of the code from [react-native-rss-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-rss-parser), modified to work on the deno backend used by supabase

### Backend made with supabase db + edge functions for web crawler
### Frontend made with Svelte (vite template)

#### The usual npm run stuff blah blah
