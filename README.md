## Shameless [The Gamer's Post](https://thegamerspost.com/) ripoff, for fun (and because TGP is down right now) :)

### Live version at [thegamerspost.sonkin.no](https://thegamerspost.sonkin.no)

The quality is not as good as the actual TGP site, but whatever :)

The rss parser is mostly a copy of the code from [react-native-rss-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-rss-parser), modified to work on the deno backend used by supabase

### Backend made with supabase db + edge functions for web crawler
### Frontend made with Svelte (vite template)

#### The usual npm run stuff blah blah
